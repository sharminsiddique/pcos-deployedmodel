Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects about 5-10% of women worldwide.
This is a repo where a model has been created via Streamlit for predicting the likelihood of PCOS from health markers. 

The Kaggle was analysed to:
- explore the data 
- determine what health markers are most correlated/are most affected by having PCOS
- find what models could predict having/not having PCOS with any degree of accuracy 
- determine if can we create a predictive model for PCOS?

The aim was also to answer the following: 
- How do factors correlate for individuals with/without PCOS? Age, BMI, hormone levels etc..

The highest correlating factors to having PCOS were the following: 
  The amount of follicles on the left and right ovaries,
  Whether someone experienced skin darkening, excessive hair growth, excessive weight gain, pimples, hair loss
  Whether their cycle was regular or irregular, 
  Whether they consumed fast food,
  Their weight, BMI, waist and hip size, their endometrial thickness, their average follicle size on their left ovary, and their AMH level.

This all cooincides with research for symptoms individuals experience when they have PCOS. 

There is no current cure for PCOS. 

Heres hoping, that in the future, there can be a cure and better management of symptoms. Until then, maybe we can create more accurate models for predicting PCOS?           
      
Tools used: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (metrics, preprocessing and classification models), Matplotlib, Seaborn and Streamlit.
